fftMPI, a distributed-memory parallel FFT library :c,h3

:line

This is the home page for the fftMPI library.  It performs 3d or 2d
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) in parallel where the FFT grid is
distributed across processors.

The fftMPI library computes 3d and 2d FFTs in parallel as sets of 1d
FFTs (via an external library) in each dimension of the FFT grid,
interleaved with "MPI communication"_mpi to move data between
processors.

Features and limitations of fftMPI: :h4

3d or 2d FFTs
complex-to-complex FFTs
double or single precision
compute FFTs in place, or output to separate memory
runs on any number of processors, including 1 proc
allowed grid size in each dimension = any product of 2,3,5 prime factors
grid decomposition = arbitrary "tiling across MPI tasks"_doc/intro.html
initial/final decompositions of grid can be different (useful for convolutions)
auto-tuning option for a few parameters which affect performance
1d FFTs computed by an external library: "FFTW"_fftw, "MKL"_mkl, or "KISS"_kiss
data movement/reordering methods can be used without FFTs
invoke multiple instances of the library (e.g. with MPI sub-communicators)
callable from C++ or any language via a C interface (e.g. C, Fortran, Python)
test programs and interface files included for all 4 of these languages
CPU only execution, currently no OpenMP or GPU support :ul

:line

The fftMPI library is open-source code, distributed freely under the
terms of the modified "Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
License"_bsd.  See "this page"_open_source.html for more details.  It
was developed at "Sandia National Laboratories"_snl, a US "Department
of Energy"_doe facility

:line

The fftMPI library is used in "LAMMPS"_http://lammps.sandia.gov, a
parallel molecular dynamics (MD) code, to perform Poisson solves for
long-range Coulombic interactions via the particle-particle
particle-mesh (PPPM) method.  It is also used in
"SPARTA"_http://sparta.sandia.gov, a parallel Direct Simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) code, to perform analyses of turbulent flows.

The fftMPI library replaces the older "Parallel FFT Package"_oldfft,
which we developed in the late 1990s for LAMMPS.  The older package is
also available from this "download site"_download.

The main author of fftMPI is "Steve Plimpton"_sjp, who can be
contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov. These collaborators have also
contributed:

Axel Kohlmemer (Temple U): support for FFTW3 and KISS libraries
Phil Blood (PSC): single precision option
Paul Coffman (IBM): optimized MPI collective option :ul

You can "send me an email"_sjp on any of these topics:

If you use fftMPI for something interesting, you can let me
know. :ulb,l

If you write a paper using fftMPI, I can post a citation on "this
page"_papers.html :l

If you have ideas for enhancing fftMPI, we can discuss including your
improvements in a future release. :l,ule

Funding to add some features and release fftMPI as a stand-alone
library came from DOE's "Office of Advanced Scientific Computing
Program"_oascr (OASCR) under the auspices of its "Exascale Computing
Program"_ecp (ECP).  

Other freely available parallel FFT libraries include:

"SWFFT"_SWFFT from Adrian Pope (Argonne National Laboratory)
"PFFT"_PFFT from Michael Pippig (Technische Universitat Chemnitz)
"P3DFFT"_P3DFFT from Dmitry Pekurovsky (UCSD)
"FFTW"_fftw (see "this doc page"_fftwmpi) from Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson (MIT) :ul

The release of the "SWFFT library"_SWFFT, available on GitLab, was
also funded by the DOE ECP.  SWFFT is a stand-alone version of the
FFTs used in "HACC"_HACC, a particle-based cosmology code that models
the universe on the largest DOE supercomputers.  The HACC project is
led by Salman Habib at ANL.

The fftMPI and SWFFT libraries are similar in scope, but also have
some algorithmic and feature differences, motivated by their use in
different applications (LAMMPS and HACC).
