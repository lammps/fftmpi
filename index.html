<CENTER><H3>fftMPI, a distributed-memory parallel FFT library 
</H3></CENTER>
<HR>

<P>This is the home page for the fftMPI library.  It performs 3d or 2d
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) in parallel where the FFT grid is
distributed across processors.

<P>The fftMPI library computes 3d and 2d FFTs in parallel as sets of 1d
FFTs (via an external library) in each dimension of the FFT grid,
interleaved with <A HREF = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI communication</A> to move data between
processors.
</P>
<H4>Features and limitations of fftMPI: 
</H4>
<UL><LI>3d or 2d FFTs
<LI>complex-to-complex FFTs
<LI>double or single precision
<LI>compute FFTs in place, or output to separate memory
<LI>runs on any number of processors, including 1 proc
<LI>allowed grid size in each dimension = any product of 2,3,5 prime factors
<LI>grid decomposition = arbitrary <A HREF = "doc/intro.html">tiling across MPI tasks</A>
<LI>initial/final decompositions of grid can be different (useful for convolutions)
<LI>auto-tuning option for a few parameters which affect performance
<LI>1d FFTs computed by an external library: <A HREF = "http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</A>, <A HREF = "mkl">MKL</A>, or <A HREF = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft">KISS</A>
<LI>data movement/reordering methods can be used without FFTs
<LI>invoke multiple instances of the library (e.g. with MPI sub-communicators)
<LI>callable from C++ or any language via a C interface (e.g. C, Fortran, Python)
<LI>test programs and interface files included for all 4 of these languages
<LI>CPU only execution, currently no OpenMP or GPU support 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>The fftMPI library is open-source code, distributed freely under the
terms of the modified <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
License</A>.  See <A HREF = "open_source.html">this page</A> for more details.  It
was developed at <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</A>, a US <A HREF = "http://www.doe.gov">Department
of Energy</A> facility
</P>
<HR>

<P>The fftMPI library is used in <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A>, a
parallel molecular dynamics (MD) code, to perform Poisson solves for
long-range Coulombic interactions via the particle-particle
particle-mesh (PPPM) method.  It is also used in
<A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov">SPARTA</A>, a parallel Direct Simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) code, to perform analyses of turbulent flows.
</P>
<P>The fftMPI library replaces the older <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/docs/fft/README.html">Parallel FFT Package</A>,
which we developed in the late 1990s for LAMMPS.  The older package is
also available from this <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html">download site</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The main author of fftMPI is <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A>, who can be
contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov. These collaborators have also
contributed:
</P>
<UL><LI>Axel Kohlmemer (Temple U): support for FFTW3 and KISS libraries
<LI>Phil Blood (PSC): single precision option
<LI>Paul Coffman (IBM): optimized MPI collective option 
</UL>
<P>You can <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">send me an email</A> on any of these topics:
</P>
<UL><LI>If you use fftMPI for something interesting, you can let me
know. 

<LI>If you write a paper using fftMPI, I can post a citation on <A HREF = "papers.html">this
page</A> 

<LI>If you have ideas for enhancing fftMPI, we can discuss including your
improvements in a future release. 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>Funding to add some features and release fftMPI as a stand-alone
library came from DOE's <A HREF = "https://science.energy.gov/ascr">Office of Advanced Scientific Computing
Program</A> (OASCR) under the auspices of its <A HREF = "https://www.exascaleproject.org">Exascale Computing
Program</A> (ECP).  
</P>
<P>Other freely available parallel FFT libraries include:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/hacc/SWFFT">SWFFT</A> from Adrian Pope (Argonne National Laboratory)
<LI><A HREF = "https://github.com/mpip/pfft">PFFT</A> from Michael Pippig (Technische Universitat Chemnitz)
<LI><A HREF = "https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft">P3DFFT</A> from Dmitry Pekurovsky (UCSD)
<LI><A HREF = "http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</A> (see <A HREF = "http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI.html#Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI">this doc page</A>) from Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson (MIT) 
</UL>
<P>The release of the <A HREF = "https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/hacc/SWFFT">SWFFT library</A>, available on GitLab, was
also funded by the DOE ECP.  SWFFT is a stand-alone version of the
FFTs used in <A HREF = "https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/1/211098-hacc/fulltext">HACC</A>, a particle-based cosmology code that models
the universe on the largest DOE supercomputers.  The HACC project is
led by Salman Habib at ANL.
</P>
<P>The fftMPI and SWFFT libraries are similar in scope, but also have
some algorithmic and feature differences, motivated by their use in
different applications (LAMMPS and HACC).
