fftMPI Papers :h3

If you use fftMPI in one of your publications, please reference the
URL of the "fftMPI website"_fws, namely http://fftmpi.sandia.gov.

At some point we may write a new paper about fftMPI, in which case we
will post a citation here.

This is an older paper which includes a discussion of the basic
algorithms used in our original "Parallel FFT Package"_oldfft, which
are also still used in fftMPI:
