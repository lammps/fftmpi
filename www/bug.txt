What version of fftMPI do you have? :h4,link(version)

An fftMPI "version" is the date when it was released, such as 25 Oct
2018.  The fftMPI is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of fftPMI contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is stored in the
src/version.h file in the fftMPI distribution.  It is also in the
fftMPI directory name created when you unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the fftMPI website, they
always describe the most current version of fftMPI. :ulb,l
