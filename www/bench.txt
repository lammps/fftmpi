Benchmarks :h3

These are timings for 3d FFTs (dobule precision, complex-to-complex)
using the fftMPI library on different machines and node hardware
(see details below).

FFTs of different sizes were run on different node counts.  The
Gflop/node performance is computed as 5Nlog2(N) flops per FFT / CPU
time.  N is the total count of 3d grid points.  E.g. N = 262144 for a
64x64x64 FFT.  The initial spatial decomposition of the FFT grid was
into 3d bricks (one per MPI task).  The final decomposition was the
same.  So the FFT cost includes operations to both remap the grid
before performing the initial set of 1d FFTs, and to remap the grid
after the final set of 1d FFTs.

These tests were run in early 2018 using the fftmpi/test/test3d.cpp
code included in the fftMPI distribution.  Click on a plot to

The tables have a line for each data point in the corresponding plot
with the following fields:

Size = size of FFT grid
Nodes = nodes used in run
MPI = total MPI task count across all nodes
CPU = seconds for 1 FFT, averaged over one or more forward/inverse pairs of FFTs
Gflops = 5Nlog2(N) / CPU
Coll = collective setting: 0 = point, 1 = all2all, 2 = combo
Exch = exchange setting: 0 = pencil, 1 = brick
Pack = pack setting: 0 = array, 1 = ptr, 2 = memcpy :ul

See the "setup() API"_doc/api_setup.html doc page for more details on
the meaning of these 3 settings.  The choice of settings were
determined by using the "tune() method"_doc/api_tune.html of fftMPI to
auto-tune its performance for a particular FFT size and node count.
