<P>
This package is a set of routines to perform 2d and 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
parallel computers.
<P>
It was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department
of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source
code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU Public License
(GPL) - see the LICENSE file in the distribution.
<P>
The author of this package is <A HREF =
"http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A>, who can be
contacted at <A HREF =
"mailto:sjplimp@sandia.gov">sjplimp@sandia.gov</A> This <A HREF =

www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html is where the latest version
of this package can be downloaded.
<P>
These routines are designed for distributed-memory parallel
machines and use MPI as their message-passing protocol. Actually the
routines only perform the data movement tasks necessary to compute
multi-dimensional FFTs in parallel; the transforms themselves are
computed by on-processor 1d FFT routines provided by the machine
vendor or the freely available <A HREF="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</A>
package. The data remapping routines can also be called directly by
the user (independent of the FFTs) to change the layout of an
application's 2d or 3d arrays across processors. </P>
<P>
The parallel FFT and remapping routines are written in C, are callable 
from Fortran, are portable to any parallel machine that supports MPI, 
can be run on any number of processors (including a single processor), 
work with any size arrays (so long as the native 1d FFT routines 
support the array dimensions), and allow considerable flexibility in 
the choice of initial and final data layout across processors.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="_cch3_931359440">Why I wrote my own parallel FFTs</A></H3>
<P>
There are other distributed-memory parallel FFTs available including 
some provided by vendors and in the <A HREF="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</A>
 package. I wrote my own because I wanted flexibility in the grid sizes, 
# of procesors, and in the data layout used as input/output by the 
FFTs. Also I needed data remapping routines for other parts of my 
applications; once you have written parallel remapping routines, 
turning them into parallel FFTs is a straightforward extension.</P>
<P>
I use these FFTs in materials modeling applications, specifically for
long-range Coulombic solvers in molecular dynamics simulations and for
plane-wave electronic structure computations. See my <A
HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">home page</A> for more
information on these applications, such as the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html">LAMMPS molecular
dynamics</A> code.</P>
<P>
These FFT routines perform their data remapping similar to the way an 
MPI_Alltoall function works: each processor in a group sends a message 
to every other processor in the group. The group can be all the 
processors or a subset, depending on the data layout. An alternative 
method that I've used previously is to do recursive swapping in a 
hypercube style of communication -- see J. S. Nelson, S. J. Plimpton, 
M. P. Sears, Phys Rev B, 47, 1765-1774 (1993).</P>
<P>
The latter method requires less messages, but a larger volume of data 
to be shipped. It's also hard to implement on a non-power-of-two # of 
processors. I believe the all-to-all style works better on current 
parallel machines with low communication latencies (e.g. the Intel and 
Cray T3E) and when processor groups can be made small (3d FFTs); I'm 
not sure which approach is better on high-latency machines such as 
clusters or for 2d FFTs.</P>

<A NAME="_cch3_931359445">Compiling</A></H3>
<P>
The appropriate routines from this package should be compiled and 
linked with your application. For a 2d FFT, use fft_2d.c, remap_2d.c, 
and pack_2d.c and their associated *.h files. The analogous 3d files 
are used for 3d FFTs. To use only the remapping routines, the fft_* 
files are not needed.</P>
<P>
You must compile the fft routines with a -D compiler flag appropriate 
to the 1d FFT machine libraries you intend to use. Available switches 
are FFT_INTEL (i.e. -DFFT_INTEL) for the Intel Paragon and Intel 
Tflops, FFT_SGI for SGI machines, FFT_DEC for Dec machines, and FFT_T3E 
for the Cray T3E. If the portable FFTW library is installed on your 
machine, the FFT_FFTW switch may be used instead. To use only the 
remapping routines an FFT switch is not needed. On the T3E you also 
must use the T3E_KLUDGE switch (i.e. -DT3E_KLUDGE) for both the fft and 
remapping routines. You must also enable the needed compiler and link 
options appropriate for the 1d FFT libraries you are using and any 
associated include files they require. </P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="_cch3_931359450">Data Layout</A></H3>
<P>
Before giving the details of how to call the 3 functions, I'll discuss 
data layout across processors and within a processor's memory. Consider 
2d and 3d arrays which are operated on by 2d and 3d FFTs and remaps. In 
your application you may wish, for parallel efficiency, to distribute 
an array across processors in a variety of ways. The FFT and remap 
routines allow you to specify how an array is mapped to processors on 
input to the routine and on output. The only requirement for a mapping 
is that each processor own a sub-section of the 2d or 3d array. In 2d 
this is a rectangular-shaped section of the 2d array; in 3d this is a 
brick-shaped section of the 3d array. Or in array notation, each 
processor must own a subsection (ilo:ihi,jlo:jhi) of the global 2d 
array and similarly for 3d arrays. </P>
<P>
On each processor, the elements for its subsection must be stored 
contiguously in memory with a fast-varying index, a mid-varying index 
(for 3d), and a slow-varying index. This means the routines can be 
called with either C-style (last index varies fastest) or Fortran-style 
(first index varies fastest) arrays; the calling routine only specifies 
the range of the fast, mid, and slow indices. It also means that 
C-style arrays of pointers to pointers are not allowed; the data must 
be contiguous in memory. For a good discussion of why this is the best 
way to store data on current RISC processors, see the <A
 HREF="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</A> documentation. Basically it's 
cheaper to do integer arithmetic to compute an array offset than it is 
to dereference pointers since the latter requires additional memory 
fetches.</P>
<P>
The FFT and remap routines allow the option of permuting the order of 
the fast, mid, and slow indices on output.  In a 2-d FFT for example,
a processor can own data in a row-wise ordering on input to the FFT and
in a column-wise ordering on output.</P>
<P>
Note that there is an implicit assumption that the subsections owned by 
all the processors do not overlap and that their union exactly tiles 
the global 2d or 3d array. It is also permissible for a particular 
processor owns no data on input and/or output, for example if the 
processor's subsection is input as (ilo:ihi,jlo:jhi) and ilo &gt; ihi. </P>
<P>
Here are some examples of the data layouts that the FFT and remap 
routines will thus allow: </P>
<P>
* Each processor initially owns a few rows (or columns) of a 2d or 3d 
array and the transformed data is returned in the same layout. </P>
<P>
* Each processor initally owns a few rows of the array; to save 
inter-processor communication inside the FFT, it is returned with each 
processor owning a few columns. Then a convolution can be performed by 
the application, followed by an inverse FFT that returns the data in 
the original row-wise layout. </P>
<P>
* Each processor initially owns a 2d or 3d subsection of the grid and 
the transformed data is returned in the same layout. Or it could be 
returned in a column-wise layout as in the previous convolution 
example. </P>
<P>
What is NOT allowed in a data layout is for a procsesor to own a 
scattered or random set of rows, columns, or subsections. Such a data 
distribution might be natural, for example, in a torus-wrap mapping of 
a matrix to processors. If this is the case in your application, you 
will need to write your own remapping routine that puts the data in an 
acceptable layout before calling the FFTs. </P>
<P>
While the FFT routines allow for a wide variety of input and output 
data layouts, they work fastest with layouts directly usable by the 
parallel FFTs, without pre- or post-remappings being necessary. This is 
discussed in the <A HREF="#_cch3_931359483">optimization</A> section.</P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="_cch3_931359457">Routine usage</A></H3>
<P>
To perform an FFT (or remap) there are 3 function calls to understand. 
Before performing an FFT for the 1st time, you create a 
&quot;plan&quot; that pre-computes and stores internally all the 
information needed to do an FFT in parallel (see <A
 HREF="#_cch3_931359505">Acknowledgements)</A>. The plan is unique to a 
particular sized array and an initial and final data layout across 
processors. You can create as many plans as you need in your 
application, though one is often sufficient. Then you perform one or 
more FFTs using a specific plan. Finally when you are finished using a 
plan for the last time, you destroy it to free up the memory it 
consumes.</P>
<P>
For example, to perform 2d FFTs in C you do somthing like the
following.  Note that in C, the indices used as calling arguments and
to index into the data arrays are C-style, meaning that they run from
0 to N-1.  When calling the routines from Fortran, use Fortran-style
indices that run from 1 to N.  You can see Fortran examples for
calling the routines in the test codes provided in the distribution.

</PRE>
<P>
The create_plan routines return NULL if there was an error creating a 
plan, typically due to a lack of memory.</P>
<P>
In MPI parlance, all the FFT and remap calls are collective in the 
sense they need to be called by all the processors in the communicator 
in order to complete successfully. Typically this would be 
MPI_COMM_WORLD (all the processors), but it can be a communicator for a 
subset of the processors. This allows multiple sets of processors to be 
doing their own FFTs simultaneously on their own data arrays, if 
desired.</P>
<P>
When calling the FFT routines from C, you include the file "fft_2d.h"
or "fft_3d.h" in your application's C file.  This defines a complex
data type FFT_DATA which is used to store the data you pass into and
receive back from the FFT routines.  When calling the FFT routines
from Fortran (F90 or F77) no header file is needed; you just pass in
the usual Fortran complex array.  Similarly, when calling the remap
routines from your C application, the "remap_2d.h" or "remap_3d.h"
header file should be included.  The data arrays passed to the remap
routines are just C doubles.</P>

<A NAME="_cch3_931359483">Optimization</A></H3>
<P>
As noted above, you can minimize communication in the FFTs by choosing 
appropriate input and output data layouts. For 2d and 3d FFTs an 
optimal input layout is one where each processor owns the entire 
fast-varying dimension of the data array. For 2d and 3d FFTs an optimal 
output layout is one where each proc owns the entire slow-varying 
dimension and permutation is specified as 1 for 2d and as 2 for 3d. 
Note that these output layouts may not make sense for your application, 
but you can still reduce communication by choosing the optimal input 
data layout. </P>

<A NAME="_cch3_931359489">Calling from Fortran</A></H3>
<P>
The FFT and remapping routines can be called from Fortran using the 
wrapper routines in fft_2d_f.c and remap_2d_f.c and similarly for 3d. 
There are 2 differences in the calling syntax from Fortran. All the 
indices run from 1 to N in standard Fortran style, instead of from 0 to 
N-1. Also, the create_plan routines require an extra final argument, a 
double precision (8 byte) Fortran variable to store the returned plan. 
Since this variable stores a pointer to the C data structure for the 
plan, it cannot be examined directly from the Fortran program to check 
it for a NULL value. Instead the wrappers print an error message if the 
create_plan routines failed. </P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="_cch3_931359494">Precision</A></H3>
<P>
The FFT routines can be used in either single or double precision mode 
be setting #define FFT_PRECISION at the top of fft_2d.h or fft_3d.h. 
The precision of the remap routines is a calling parameter. </P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="_cch3_931359499">Other Options</A></H3>
<P>
The pack routines have 3 options which can be selected with compiler 
switches. Setting ARRAY, POINTER, or MEMCPY chooses between the 3 
different sets of pack/unpack routines - e.g. -DPOINTER. The ARRAY 
option is the default. These routines are the kernels for parallel data 
movement since messages sent to other proecssors have to be packed and 
unpacked into and out of message buffers. On some machines one version 
of these tends to be faster than the others; on some machines it makes 
little difference. You can experiment with which works best by toggling 
the appropriate flag when compilng the pack_2d.c and pack_3d.c 
routines. </P>
