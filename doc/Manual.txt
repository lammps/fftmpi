Manual for the fftMPI library :c,h2
22 Dec 2020 version :c,h4

The fftMPI library is designed to perform parallel 2d or 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
distributed-memory machines using MPI (message passing interface
library) to move data between processors.

The fftMPI library was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE. It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the BSD Public
License (BSD).  See the LICENSE file in the distribution.

The primary developer of the fftMPI library is "Steve Plimpton"_sjp at
Sandia National Laboratories, who can be contacted at sjplimp at
sandia.gov. Additional collaborators are listed on the "fftMPI
website"_fws.

Additional info is available at these links:

"fftMPI website"_fws = tarball download
"GitHub site"_http://lammps.github.org/lammps/fftmpi.git = clone or report bugs, pull requests, etc
Questions, bugs, suggestions: email to sjplimp at sandia.gov or post to GitHub :ul

IMPORTANT NOTE: the GitHub site will not be stood up until ~Oct 2018.

The fftMPI library replaces the older "Parallel FFT Package"_oldfft,
which was developed around 1997 for the "LAMMPS molecular dynamics
code"_http://lammps.sandia.gov.  Both fftMPI and the older package are
available from this "download site"_download.

My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies when I was creating the
original Parallel FFT Package.  Thanks also to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding data
remapping and FFT details from the user.
