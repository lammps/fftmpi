<H3>Data layout and optimization 
</H3>
<P>To use fftMPI, an application (app) defines one or more 2d or 3d FFT
grids.  The data on these grids is owned by the app and distributed
across the processors it runs on.  To compute an FFT, each processor
passes a pointer to the memory which stores its portion of the input
grid point values.  It also passes a pointer to where it wants the
output FFT values stored.  The two pointers can be identical to
perform an in-place FFT.  See the "compute() method
API")_api_compute.html for more details.
</P>
<P>As explained on the <A HREF = "intro.html">intro</A> doc page, for fftMPI the 2d or
3d FFT grid data is distributed across processors via a "tiling".
Imagine a N1 x N2 or N1 x N2 x N3 grid partitioned into P tiles, where
P is the number of MPI tasks (processors).  Each tile is a "rectangle"
of grid points in 2d or "brick" of grid points in 3d.  Each
processor's tile can be any size or shape, including empty.  The P
individual tiles cannot overlap; their union is the entire grid.  This
means each point of the global FFT grid is owned by a unique
processor.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method API</A> has arguments for each
processor to specify the global grid size, as well as the bounds of
its tile for input, and also for output.  The input and output tilings
can be different, which is useful for performing a convolution
operation as described below.  There is also an option to permute the
ordering of data on each processor on ouput versus its initial
ordering.
</P>
<P>Each processor must store the data for its tile contiguously in
memory.  The <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method API</A> arguments for the
global grid size are (nfast,nmid,nslow) for 3d FFTs and (nfast,nslow)
for 2d FFT.  These do NOT refer to spatial dimensions, e.g. x,y,z.
Instead they refer to how the grid points stored by each processor in
its tile of values are ordered in its local memory.
</P>
<P>Each grid point value is a complex datum, with both a real and
imaginary value.  Those 2 values are stored consecutively in memory.
For double-precision FFTs, each value is a 64-bit floating point
number.  For single-precision FFTS, it is a 32-bit floating point
number.  For the tile of grid points, the nfast dimension varies
fastest (i.e. two grid points whose fast index differs by 1 are
consecutive in memory), the nmid dimension (for 3d) varies next
fastest, and the nslow dimension varies slowest.
</P>
<P>Again, to reemphasize, for a 3d grid the fftMPI library does NOT know
or care which of the 3 indices correspond to spatial dimensions x,y,z
but only which are the fast, mid, slow indices.
</P>
<HR>

<P>As a concrete example, assume a global 3d FFT grid is defined with
(nfast,mid,nslow) = (32,20,45) and a particular processor owns a 2x3x2
tile of the 3d grid, which could be located anywhere within the global
grid.  That processor thus owns data for 2x3x2 = 12 grid points.  It
stores 12 complex datums or 24 floating point numbers.  For double
precision, this would be 24*8 = 192 bytes of grid data.
</P>
<P>The processor must store its 24 floating point values contiguously in
memory as follows, where R/I are the real/imaginary pair of values for
one complex datum:
</P>
<PRE>R1, I1, R2, I2, ... R23, I23, R24, I24 
</PRE>
<P>Call the 3 indices of the global grid I,J,K.  For the 2x3x2 tile, an
individual complex grid point is Gijk.  Then the 12 grid points must
be ordered in memory as:
</P>
<PRE>G111, G211, G121, G221, G131, G231, G112, G212, G122, G222, G132, G232 
</PRE>
<P>Finally, as mentioned above, a permuted ordering can be specified for
output of the FFT.  This means that the ordering of data is altered
within each output tile stored by all the processors.  For example,
for a 2d FFT, all processors can own data with a row-wise ordering on
input, and with a column-wise ordering on output.  See the discussion
of a convolution operation below.  The <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A>
doc page explains permutation in detail, and gives a concrete example.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Here are a few other points worth mentioning:
</P>
<UL><LI>For C++ or C, a processor can store its tile as a 2d or 3d array
accessed by pointers to pointers, e.g. a "double **array2d" or "double
**array3d".  However, the underlying data must be allocated so as to
be contiguous in memory.  The address of the first datum should be
used when calling fffMPI, not the "double **" or "double ***" pointer.
The library will then treat the data as a 1d vector. 

<LI>For Fortran, a 2d or 3d array is always allocated so that the data is
contiguous, so the name of the array can be used when calling fftMPI.
Note that in Fortran array data is stored with the first index varying
fastest, e.g. array(4,2) follows array(3,2) in memory for a 2d array.
For C/C++ it is the opposite.  The last index varies fastest,
e.g. array<B>3</B><B>3</B> follows array<B>3</B><B>2</B> in memory. 

<LI>For Python, you must use Numpy vectors or arrays to store a tile of
grid points.  They allocate the underlying data contiguously with a
C-like ordering.  You can simple call fftMPI with the name of the
vector or array; the Python wrapper will convert that to a pointer to
the underlying 1d vector which it passes to fftMPI. 

<LI>What is NOT allowed in a data layout is for a procsesor to own a
scattered or random set of rows, columns, grid sub-sections, or
individual grid points of a 2d or 3d grid.  Such a data distribution
might be natural, for example, in a torus-wrap mapping of a 2d matrix
to processors.  If this is the case for your app, you will need to
write your own remapping method that puts the data in an acceptable
layout for input to fftMPI. 

<LI>It's OK for a particular processor to own no data on input and/or
output.  E.g. if there are more processors than grid points in a
particular dimension.  In this case the processor subsection in 2d
should be specifed as (ilo:ihi,jlo:jhi) with ilo > ihi and/or jlo >
jhi.  Similarly in 3d. 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>Here are example array allocations for a processor's tile of data for
a 3d double-precision FFT where the tile size is 30x20x10 in the
nfast,nmid,nslow dimesions.  Note the difference between Fortran
versus the other languages based on native array storage order
as discussused in the preceeding bullets.
</P>
<P>Each grid point stores a (real,imaginary) pair of values in
consecutive memory locations.  So the arrays can be defined as 4d
where dim=2 varies fastest, or 3d where the nfast dim=30 is doubled.
</P>
<P>C or C++:
</P>
<PRE>double grid<B>10</B><B>20</B><B>30</B><B>2</B>;
double grid<B>10</B><B>20</B><B>60</B>; 
</PRE>
<P>Fortran:
</P>
<PRE>real(8), dimension(2,30,20,10) grid
real(8), dimension(60,20,10) grid 
</PRE>
<P>Python:
</P>
<PRE>grid = numpy.zeros(<B>10,20,30,2</B>,np.float64) 
grid = numpy.zeros(<B>10,20,60</B>,np.float64) 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>Here are examples of conceptual data layouts that fftMPI allows:
</P>
<UL><LI>Each processor initially owns a few rows (or columns) of a 2d grid or
planes of a 3d grid and the transformed data is returned in the same
layout. 

<LI>Each processor initally owns a few rows of a 2d array or planes or
pencils of a 3d array.  To save communication inside the FFT, the
output layout is different, with each processor owning a few columns
(2d) or planes or pencils in a different dimension (3d).  Then a
convolution can be performed by the application after the forward FFT,
followed by an inverse FFT that returns the data to its original
layout. 

<LI>Each processor initially owns a 2d or 3d subsection of the grid
(rectangles or bricks) and the transformed data is returned in the
same layout. Or it could be returned in a column-wise or pencil layout
as in the convolution example of the previous bullet. 
</UL>
<HR>

<H4>Optimization of data layouts 
</H4>
<P>As explained on the <A HREF = "intro.html">intro</A> doc page, a 2d FFT for a N1 x
N2 grid is performed as a set of N2 1d FFTs in the first dimension,
followed by N1 1d FFTs in the 2nd dimension.  A 3d FFT for a N1 x N2 x
N3 grid is performed as N2*N3 1d FFTs in the first dimension, then
N1*N3 1d FFTs in the 2nd, then N1*N2 1d FFTs in the third dimension.
</P>
<P>In the context of the discussion above, this means the 1st set of 1d
FFTs is performed in the fast-varying dimension, and the last set of
1d FFTs is performed in the slow-varying dimension.  For 3d FFTs, the
middle set of 1d FFTs is performed in the mid-varying dimension.
</P>
<P>While fftMPI allows for a variety of input and output data layouts, it
will run fastest when the input and outputs layout do not require
additional data movement before or after performing an FFT.
</P>
<P>For both 2d and 3d FFTs an optimal input layout is one where each
processor already owns the entire fast-varying dimension of the data
array and each processor has (roughly) the same amount of data.  In
this case, no initial remapping of data is required; the first set of
1d FFTs can be performed immediately.
</P>
<P>Similarly, an optimal output layout is one where each processor owns
the entire slow-varying dimension and again (roughly) the same amount
of data.  Additionally it is one where the permutation is specified as
1 for 2d and as 2 for 3d, so that what was originally the slow-varying
dimension is now the fast-varying dimension (for the last set of 1d
FFTs).  In this case, no final remapping of data is required; the data
can be left in the layout used for the final set of 1d FFTs.  This is
a good way to perform the convolution operation explained above.
</P>
<P>Note that these input and output layouts may or may not make sense for
a specific app.  But using either or both of them will reduce the cost
of the FFT operation.
