<H3>API for FFT tune() 
</H3>
<P>This fftMPI method performs auto-tuning of the collective, exchange,
and packflag variables listed on the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup</A> dic page
to determine which settings produce the fastest FFT.  The code
examples at the bottom of the page are for 3d FFTs.  Just replace "3d"
by "2d" for 2d FFTs.  Note that the tune() method has a 3d and 2d
version.
</P>
<P>An alternative to the tune() method is the setup() method described on
the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup API</A> doc page.  In this case the 3 variables
are set explicitly before calling setup().  One or the other method
must be invoked before computing actual FFTs, but not both.

<P>The tune() method sets the internal values of the collective,
exchange, packflag variables discussed on the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup
API</A> doc page by performing a series of trial runs,
where one or more FFTs with the global grid size and data layout.
</P>
<P>The trial FFTs use dummy FFT grids allocated internally by fftMPI
and filled with zeroes.  If memory is an issue in your application,
it does not need to allocate its own memory for FFT grids until
after tune() is complete.
</P>
<P>The final values of the 3 variables can be queried after tuning is
complete via the methods discussed on the <A HREF = "api_stats.html">stats API</A>
doc page.
</P>
<P>All the arguments from nfast to recvsize have the same meaning for
tune() as they do for the setup() method, discssed on the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup
API</A> doc page.  This means all the FFT trials will be
run on the same size global grid and with the same initial/final data
tilings as the eventual actual FFTs.
</P>
<P>If flag is set to 0, pairs of forward and backward FFTs are performed
in the trials.  If flag is set to 1, only forward FFTs are performed
in the trials.  If flag is set to -1, only backward FFTs are performed
in the trials.
</P>
<P>The niter argument sets how many FFTs are performed in each trial (or
pairs of FFTs for flag = 0).
</P>
<P>The tmax argument sets a time limit (in CPU seconds) for how long the
tune operation will take.  A value of 0.0 means no time limit is
enforced.
</P>
<P>If tflag is set to 0, only full FFTs will be timed.  If tflag is set
to 1, 1d FFTs and data remapping operations will also be timed.
</P>
<P>Timing data for all operations (2d/3d FFT, optional 1d FFTs only,
optional data remappings) for each timing trial can be queried after
tuning is complete via the methods discussed on the <A HREF = "api_stats.html">stats
API</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>A sequence of 9 trial runs is performed as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>First, a test run of a single forward FFT is performed using the
current values of the collective, exchange, packflag variables.  Its
CPU cost is used to estimate the time needed for all the trials.  If
this time exceeds tmax, then less trials are performed, as explained
below. 

<LI>Six trials are performed using all combinations of the collective and
exchange variable.  I.e. collective = 0,1,2; exchange = 0,1.  The
fastest of these 6 trials sets the value of collective and
exchange. 

<LI>Three trials are performed for packflag = 1,2,3, using the optimal
collective and exchange values.  The fastest of these 3 trials sets
the value packflag. 
</UL>
<P>If performing all 9 trials with niter FFTs per trial will take more
time than tmax, the following logic is invoked to limit the tuning
time:
</P>
<UL><LI>Reduce niter to less than the requested value and perform the 9
trials. 

<LI>If more time reduction is needed even with niter = 1, only perform the
first 6 trials (to set collective, exchange).  Set packflag to its
default value of 2. 

<LI>If more time reduction is needed, only perform 3 trials (to set
collective).  Set exchange to its default value of 0 and packflag
to its default value of 2. 

<LI>If more time reduction is needed, only perform 2 trials with
collective = 1,2.  Set exchange to its default value of 0 and packflag
to its default value of 2. 

<LI>If more time reduction is needed, and the initial collective,
exchange, packflag are variables do not have default values, perform
just 1 trial with default values assigned to the 3 variables. 

<LI>If no trials can be performed (i.e. the single forward FFT exceeded
tmax/2), just leave the collective, exchange, packflag variables set
to their initial values, and use the test run results as the first and
only trial.
