<H3>Running the test programs 
</H3>
<P>The test programs (apps) in the test dir illustrate how to use fftMPI.
They also enable experiementation with and benchmarking of the various
methods and options that fftMPI supports.  All of the apps can be
launched on any number of processors (including a single processor)
via mpirun.
</P>
<P>Here are example launch commands.  Those without a leading mpirun will
run on a single processor:
</P>
<PRE>% simple
% simple_f90
% mpirun -np 12 simple
% mpirun -np 4 simple_c
% mpirun -np 8 python simple.py 
</PRE>
<P>The simple apps take no command-line arguments.  To change the size of
the FFT you need to edit the 3 "FFT size" lines near the top of each
file.
</P>
<PRE>% test3d -g 100 100 100 -n 50
% test3d_c -g 100 100 100 -n 50 -m 1 -i step
% mpirun -np 8 test3d_f90 -g 100 100 100 -n 50 -c all
% mpirun -np 16 test2d -g 1000 2000 -n 100 -t details
% mpirun -np 4 test2d_c -g 500 500 -n 1000 -i 492893 -v
% test2d_f90 -g 256 256 -n 1000
% python test3d.py -g 100 100 100 -n 50
% mpirun -np 16 python test3d.py -g 100 100 100 -n 50 
</PRE>
<P>The test apps take a variety of optional command-line arguments, all
of which are explained below.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: To run the Python apps, you must enable Python to find
the fftMPI shared library and src/fftmpi.py wrapper script.  To run
the Python apps in parallel, you must have mpi4py installed in your
Python.  See the <A HREF = "usage.html">usage</A> doc page for details on both these
topics.
</P>
<HR>

<H4>Command-line arguments: 
</H4>
<P>All possible command-line arguments are listed here.  All the
setttings have default values, so you only need to specify those you
wish to change.  Additional details are explained below.  An
explanation of the output of the test programs is also given below.
</P>
<P>The test3d (C++) and test3d_c (C) and test3d.py (Python) apps perform
3d FFTs and use identical command-line arguments.  The test2d (C++)
and test2d_c (C) and test2d.py (Python) apps perform 2d FFTs and take
identical arguments to the 3d apps except as noted below for -g, -pin,
or -pout.
</P>
<P>Note that all the 3d apps should produce identical numerical results,
and give very similar performance to each other, since the work is
being done by the fftMPI library.  Ditto for the 2d apps.

<H4>More details on the command-line arguments: 
</H4>
<P>The -g option is for the FFT grid size.
</P>
<P>The -pin and -pout options determine how the FFT grid is partitioned
across processors before and after the FFT.
</P>
<P>The -n option is the number of iterations (FFTs) to perform.  Note
that for modes 0 and 1, each iteration will involve 2 FFTs (forward
and inverse).
</P>
<P>The -m option selects the mode, which chooses between full FFTs versus
convolution FFTs and determines what 1 iteration means.  For full
FFTs, a forward FFT returns data to its original decomposition.
Likewise for an inverse FFT.  For convolution FFTS, the data is left
in a z-pencil decomposition after a 3d forward FFT or a y-pencil
decomposition after a 2d forward FFT.  The inverse FFT starts from the
z- or y-pencil decomposition and returns the data to its original
decomposition.
</P>
<P>The -i option determines how the values in the FFT grid are
initialized.
</P>
<P>The -tune option performs an auto-tuning operation before it performs
the FFTs.  It sets the values that could be otherwise specified by the
-c, -e, -p options.  So if those options are also specified, they are
ignored if -tune is specified.  See the <A HREF = "api_tune.html">library tune
API</A> for details on the auto-tuning procedure.
</P>
<P>The -c option is specified as point or all or combo.  It determines
whether point2point or all2all communication is performed when the FFT
grid data is moved to new processors between successive 1d FFTs.  See
the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">library setup API</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The -e option is specified as pencil or brick.  For 3d FFTs with
pencil, there are 4 communication stages for a full FFT: brick ->
x-pencil -> y-pencil -> z-pencil -> brick.  Or 3 for a 3d convoultion
FFT (last stage is skipped).  Or 3 for a full 2d FFT (no z-pencil
decomposition).  Or 2 for a 2d convolution FFT.  For 3d FFTs with
brick, there are 6 communication stages for a full FFT: brick ->
x-pencil -> brick -> y-pencil -> brick -> z-pencil -> brick.  Or 5 for
a 3d convoultion FFT (last stage is skipped).  Or 4 for a full 2d FFT
(no z-pencil decomposition).  Or 3 for a 2d convolution FFT.  See the
<A HREF = "api_setup.html">library setup API</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The -p option is specified as array or ptr or memcpy.  This setting
determins what low-level methods are used for packing and unpacking
FFT data that is sent as messages via MPI.  See the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">library setup
API</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The -t option produces more timing output by the test app.
</P>
<P>The -r option performs no 1d FFTs, it only moves the FFT grid data
(remap) between processors.
</P>
<P>The -o option prints out grid values before and after the FFTs and is
useful for debugging.  It should only be used for small grids, else
the volume of output can be immense.
</P>
<P>The -v option verifies a correct result after all the FFTs are
complete.  FFT is performed.  The results for each grid point should
be within epsilon of the starting values.  It can only be used for
modes 0 and 1, when both forward and inverse FFTs are performed.

<P>This output is only produced when the "-tune" option is used.  In this
case 9 tuning trials were run, each for 5 iterations (5 or 10 FFTs
depending on the -m mode).  The "coll exch pack" settings for the 9
runs are listed next.  These correspond to the "-c", "-e", "-p"
settings described above:
</P>
<UL><LI>-c: 0 = point, 1 = all, 2 = combo
<LI>-e: 0 = pencil, 1 = brick
<LI>-p: 0 = array, 1 = ptr, 2 = memcpy 
</UL>
<P>The timings for each trial are listed following the coll/exch/pack settings.
The 3dFFT timing is the total time for the trial.  In this case
the other timings are 0.0 because the -tune extra setting was 0.  If it
had been 1, then an additional timing breakdown for each trial run
would be output.
</P>
<P>In this case all 6 permutations of "-c" and "-e" were tried.  Then the
3 -p options were used with the fastest of the previous 6 runs.  The
fastest run of all was with -c = 2 (combo), -e = 1 (brick), and -p = 2
(memcpy).
</P>
<P>The number of trials and the number of iterations/trial can be adjusted
by the tune() method of fffMPI to limit the tuning to the specified
-tune tmax setting.

<P>These are the number of FFTs that were performed for the timing
results that follow.  They were run with the coll/exch/pack settings
shown, which are the optimal settings from the tuning trials in this
case.  The first memory usage line is for the FFT grid owned by the

</PRE>
<P>This is the timing breakdown of both the setup (initialize by app, FFT
setup by fftMPI), the tuning (if performed), and the FFTs themselves.
The time per FFT is also give, as well as the flop rate.  There are
5Nlog2(N) flops performed in an FFT, where N is the total number of 2d
or 3d grid points and the log is base 2.  The flop rate is aggregate
across all the processors.

Time for remap #4 = 0.0452759 secs
  fraction of time in remap #4 = 0.126919 
</PRE>
<P>This extra output is only produced if the "-t" option is used.  It
gives a breakdown of where the total FFT time was spent.  The
breakdown is roughly: total = 1d FFTs + remaps.  In this case 100% =
36% + 62%.  And total remap = remap #1 + #2 + #3 + #4.  In this case
62% = 8% + 12% + 24% + 13%.  The summations are not exact (i.e. they
don't sum exactly to 100%), because the breakdown timings are
performed by separate runs, and timings are not exactly reproducible
from run to run.  There can also be load-imbalance effects when full
FFTs are timed by themselves, versus individual components being run
and timed individually.
</P>
<P>The remaps operations include the cost for data movement (from one
processor to another) and data reordering (on-processor) operations.
In this 3d case, there were 4 flavors of remap.  From initial grid to
x pencils (#1), from x to y pencils (#2), from y to z pencils (#3),
and from z pencils to final grid (same as initial grid).  Depending on
the choice of mode, some of these remaps may not be performed.  Also,
for modes 0,1 there are 2 FFTs per iteration, so the per-remap timings
are averaged over the communication required in both the forward and
inverse directions.  E.g. remap #3 would be the average time for y to
z pencil for the forward FFT, and z to y pencil for the inverse FFT.
