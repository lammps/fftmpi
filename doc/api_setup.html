<H3>API for FFT setup() and setup_memory() 
</H3>
<P>These fftMPI methods are invoked once to setup an FFT.  They define
the global grid size, the input/output layouts of data across
processors, and various parameters which can affect how the FFT is
computed.  The code examples at the bottom of the page are for 3d
FFTs.  Just replace "3d" by "2d" for 2d FFTs.  Note that the setup()
method has a 3d and 2d version.
</P>
<P>An alternative to the setup() method is the tune() method described on
the <A HREF = "api_tune.html">tune API</A> doc page.  One or the other method must
be invoked before computing actual FFTs, but not both.
</P>

<P>The first 6 lines in the API section above are names of public
variables within the FFT class which can be set to enable options.
All of them have reasonable default settings.  So you typically don't
need to reset them.
</P>
<P>If reset, the first 4 variables must be set before the setup() call.
Once setup() is invoked, changing them has no effect.
</P>
<P>The last 2 variables can be set (or changed) anytime before the
<A HREF = "api_compute.html">compute()</A> method is called to perform an FFT.
</P>
<P>To set these variables from C, Fortran, Python, there is a set()
method which needs to be called.  See syntax details in the code
examples below.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The "collective" variable = 0/1/2 corresponds to 3 algorithmic choices
for performing collective communication when FFT grid data moves to
new processors between stages of 1d FFTs.
</P>
<P>The "point" setting (0) invokes point-to-point MPI_Send() and
MPI_Receive() methods between pairs of processors to send/receive
data.
</P>
<P>The "all" setting (1) invokes the MPI_All2all() method within subsets
of processors that need to exchange data.
</P>
<P>The "combo" setting (2) is a combination of the other options.  It
invokes point-to-point MPI methods for pencil-to-brick data movement,
and the all2all MPI method for pencil-to-pencil data movement.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The "exchange" variable = 0/1 corresponds to 2 algorithmic choices for
how many times FFT grid data moves to new processors between stages of
1d FFTs.
</P>
<P>The "pencil" setting (0) moves data once between each pair of 1d FFT
stages.  For example, assume the fast dimension corresponds to x, and
the slow dimension to y.  Then to move data bewteen an x-pencil layout
to a y-pencil layout, one data remap is performed.
</P>
<P>The "brick" setting (1) moves data twice between each pair of 1d FFT
stages.  For example, to move data bewteen an x-pencil layout to a
y-pencil layout, one data remap is performed to go from an x-pencil
layout to a 3d brick (or 2d rectangle) layout, and a second data remap
to go from brick (rectangle) layout to a y-pencil layout.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The "packflag" variable = 0/1/2 corresponds to 3 algorithmic choices
for packing/unpacking FFT grid data into MPI communication buffers.
</P>
<P>The "array" setting (0) accesses the local FFT grid data as a 3d (or
2d) array.
</P>
<P>The "ptr" setting (1) accesses the local FFT grid data as a 1d vector
using pointers.
</P>
<P>The "memcpy" setting (2) is similar to the "ptr" setting, except data
is copied via a memcpy() function rather than be looping over it one
datum at a time.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If the "memoryflag" variable is 1, then fftMPI will allocate memory
internally to use for sending/receiving messages.  If "memoryflag" is
set to 0, then the caller must allocate the memory and pass pointers
to the library via a setup_memory() call before the
<A HREF = "api_compute.html">compute()</A> method is invoked.  The required length
of these buffers is returned by the setup() method as sendsize and
recvsize.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If the "scaled" variable is 1, then a forward FFT followed by an
inverse FFT will return values equal to the initial FFT grid values.
If the "scaled" variable is 0, then the same operation would produce
final values that are a factor of N larger than the initial values,
where N = total # of points in the FFT grid (3d or 2d).
</P>
<HR>

<P>The setup() method can only be called once.  Only the 3d case is
illustrated below for each language; the 2d analogs should be clear.
</P>
<P>The nfast, nmid, nslow arguments are the size of the global 3d FFT
grid (nfast, nslow for 2d).  As explained on the <A HREF = "layout.html">layout</A>
doc page, they do NOT refer to dimensions x or y or z in a spatial
sense.  Rather they refer to the ordering of grid points in the
caller's memory for the 3d "brick" of grid points that each processor
owns.  The points in the nfast dimension are consecutive in memory,
points in the nmid dimension are separated by stride nfast in memory,
and points in the nslow dimension are separated by stride nfast*nmid.
</P>
<P>The "in/out ijk lo/hi" indices define the tile of the 3d or 2d global
grid that each processor owns before and after a forward or inverse
FFT is computed.  See the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> doc page for details
Again, i/j/k correspond to fast/mid/slow, NOT to x/y/z.
</P>
<P>As explained on the <A HREF = "layout.html">layout</A> doc page, a tile is a brick
in 3d or rectangle in 2d.  Each index can range from 0 to N-1
inclusive, where N is the corresponding global grid dimension.  The
lo/hi indices are the first and last point (in that dimension) that
the processor owns.  If a processor owns no grid point (e.g. on
input), then its lo index (in one or more dimensions) should be one
larger than its hi index.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When calling fftMPI from Fortran, the index ranges are
from 1 to N inclusive, not 0 to N-1.
</P>
<P>Here are three examples for 2d FFT grids:
</P>
<PRE>in_ilo = 10, in_ihi = 20
in_jlo = 100, in_jhi = 110 
</PRE>
<PRE>in_ilo = 10, in_ihi = 10
in_jlo = 100, in_jhi = 109 
</PRE>
<PRE>in_ilo = 10, in_ihi = 9
in_jlo = 100, in_jhi = 110 
</PRE>
<P>The first means the processor owns an 11x11 rectangle of grid points.
The second means the processor owns a 1x10 rectangle of grid points.
The third means the processor owns no grid points.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: It is up to the calling app to insure that a valid
tiling of the global grid across all processors is passed to fftMPI.
As explained on the <A HREF = "layout.html">layout</A> doc page, "valid" means that
every grid point is owned by a unique processor and the union of all
the tiles is the global grid.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The permute argument to setup() triggers a permutation in storage
order of fast/mid/slow for the FFT output.  A value of 0 means no
permutation.  A value of 1 means permute once = mid->fast, slow->mid,
fast->slow.  A value of 2 means permute twice = slow->fast, fast->mid,
mid->slow.  For 2d FFTs, the only allowed permute values are 0,1.  As
explained on the <A HREF = "layout">layout</A> doc page, this can be useful when
performing convolution operations, to avoid extra communication after
the FFT is performed.
</P>
<P>Note that the permute setting does not change the meaning of the "out
ijk lo/hi" indices relative to the nfast,nmid,nslow grid dimensions.
It just changes the ordering of the grid point data within a
processors output tile.  For example, say a processor's output tile is
20x60x32, located anywhere in the global Nfast x Nmid x Nslow grid.
</P>
<P>As explained on the <A HREF = "layout.html">layout</A> doc page, if permute = 0,
then on input and output the Nfast dimension varies fastest, i.e. for
a fixed pair of Nmid,Nslow indices, the 20 grid points with Nfast
indices 1 to 20 are consecutive in memory.  The Nmid dimension varies
next fastest.  And the Nslow dimension varies slowest, i.e. for a
fixed pair of Nfast,Nmid indices, the 32 grid points with Nslow
indices 1 to 32 are spaced in memory with stride = 1200 = 20*60.
</P>
<P>If permute = 1, then on output only (input ordering is not changed),
the Nmid dimension now varies fastest, i.e. for a fixed pair of
Nfast,Nslow indices, the 60 grid points with Nmid indices 1 to 60 are
consecutive in memory.  The Nslow dimension now varies next fastest.
And the Nfast dimension now varies slowest, i.e. for a fixed pair of
Nmid,Nslow indices, the 20 grid points with Nfast indices 1 to 20 are
spaced in memory with stride = 1920 = 60*32.
</P>
<P>Similarly if permute = 1, then on output only, the Nslow dimension now
varies fastest, i.e. for a fixed pair of Nfast,Nmid indices, the 32
grid points with Nslow indices 1 to 32 are consecutive in memory.  The
Nfast dimension now varies next fastest.  And the Nmid dimension now
varies slowest, i.e. for a fixed pair of Nfast,Nslow indices, the 60
grid points with Nmid indices 1 to 60 are spaced in memory with stride
= 640 = 20*32.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Three values are retured by setup().  Fftsize is the max number of FFT
grid points the processor will own at any stage of the FFT (start,
intermediate, end).  Note that it is possible for the output size to
be larger than the input size, and an intermediate size can be larger
than both the input or output sizes.
</P>
<P>Thus fftsize is the size of the FFT array the caller should allocate
to store its FFT grid points.  Note that fftsize is the # of complex
datums the processor owns.  Thus the caller allocation should be
2*fftsize doubles for double-precision FFTs, and 2*fftsize floats for
single-precision FFTs.  As explained on the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> doc
page, the caller can either perform an FFT in-place (one FFT grid) or
allocate separate input and output grids.  In the latter case, the
output grid should be of size fftsize.  The input grid can be exactly
the size of the input data (i.e. possibly smaller than fftsize).
</P>
<P>The returned sendsize and recvsize are the length of buffers needed to
perform the MPI sends and receives for the data remapping operations
for a 2d or 3d FFT.  If the memoryflag variable is set to 1 (the
default, see description above), fftMPI will allocate these buffers.
The caller can ignore sendsize and recvsize.  If the memoryflag
variable is set to 0, the caller must allocate the two buffers of
these lenghts and pass them to fftMPI via the setup_memory() method,
as explained next.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The setup_memory() method can only be called if the "memorysize"
variable is set to 1, in which case it must be called.  The caller
allocates two buffers (sendbuf and recvbuf) with lengths sendsize and
recvsize respectively, and passes them to fftMPI.  Sendsize and
recvsize are values returned by the setup() method.
</P>
<P>The FFT_SCALAR datatype in the setup_memory() API above, is defined by
fftMPI to be "double" (64-bit) or "float" (32-bit) for
double-precision or single-precision FFTs.
</P>
<P>Note that unlike fftsize, sendsize and recvsize are NOT a count of
complex values, but are the number of doubles or floats the two
buffers must be able to hold, for double- or single-precision FFTs
respectively.
