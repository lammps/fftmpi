Building the test programs :h3

The test directory has several programs that illustrate how to use
fftMPI.  They can also be used to benchmark its performance.

These are simple, compact codes (about 150 lines each) which
illustrate how to setup a distributed FFT grid and invoke fftMPI to
perform a 3d FFT.  They invoke a forward and inverse FFT and compare
the initial/final grid points to verify correctness:

simple.cpp : use fftMPI as a C++ class
simple_c.cpp : C++/C using fftMPI thru its C interface
simple_f90.f90 : Fortran using fftMPI thru its Fortran interface
simple.py : Python using fftMPI thru its Python wrapper :ul

These are more complex codes to perform 3d FFTs.  They take
a variety of command-line arguments to exercise all the options
that fftMPI supports.  They show how to call all the fftMPI methods:

test3d.cpp : use fftMPI as a C++ class
test3d_c.c : C++/C using fftMPI thru its C interface
test3d_f90.f90 : Fortran using fftMPI thru its Fortran interface 
test3d.py : Python using fftMPI thru its Python wrapper :ul

There are also test2d* files which invoke 2d FFTs.  There is no 2d
analog of the simple codes.

You can build all the simple and test programs (apps) from the test
directory, by typing:

% make :pre

The resulting executables are

C++: simple and test3d and test2d
C: simple_c and test3d_c and test2d_c
F90: simple_f90 and test3d_f90 and test2d_f90
Python: simple.py and test3d.py and test2d.py (no build necessary) :ul

The standard Makefile uses mpicxx for compiling and linking the C++
and C programs, and mpifort for the Fortran 90 programs, using
whatever C++ and Fortran compilers they wrap.  If your MPI
installation does not include Fortran support, then you will not have
an mpifort and the Fortran test programs will not build.

There are also a few provided Makefile.machine files that work on
different supercomputers.  You can use one of them or create your own
edited file and invoke it as

% make -f Makefile.machine :pre

:line

By default, the Makefile assumes it will link to a shared version of
the fftMPI library, which already incldues all the 1d FFT package
functions needed to perform FFTs.  And the test apps allocate grid
arrays to compute double-precision FFTs (one complex datum = 2 64-bit
floating point values).  And if using an Intel compiler the test apps
are built using the TBB (thread building blocks) memory allocator.

As with the src/Makefile for fftMPI, discussed on the
"compile"_compile.html doc page, these three make variables will
change those default settings.  You can add one or more of them to any
make command:

p=single     # single-precision FFTs (double is default)
fft=fftw     # options: fftw3 (same as fftw), fftw2, mkl, kiss (default)
tbb=no       # do not use TBB with Intel compiler (yes is default) :ul

Here are example make commands using these variables:

% make help                # see syntax for all options
% make p=single            # single precision, p=double is default
% make fft=fftw tbb=no     # use the FFTW3 lib for 1d FFTs
                           # options: fftw, fftw3, fftw2, mkl, kiss (default)
% make test2d p=single     # build just the C++ test2d app
% make test3d_f90 fft=mkl  # build just the Fortran test3d app

IMPORTANT NOTE: You must use the same value for the "p" variable that
was used when building the fftMPI library in the src directory.  This
insures the single- or double-precision data types used in the test
apps for the FFT grid data match what the library uses.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You only need to set the fft variable if you are
linking to a static version of the fftMPI library.  In this case,
setting the fft variable will insure the link command for each test
app needs to includes the appropriate 1d FFT package library files.

These libraries are as follows:

FFTW2: libfftw.so
FFTW3 double precision: libfftw3.so
FFTW3 single precision: libfftw3f.so
MKL built with Intel compiler: libmkl_intel_lp64.so, libmkl_sequential.so, libmkl_core.so
MKL built with GNU compiler: libmkl_gf_lp64.so, libmkl_sequential.so, libmkl_core.so
KISS: no library file :ul

If the build cannot find these library files in the directories
specified by your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable an error will
result.

If the appropriate library file is not found, you will need to add a
setting for the its directory to FFT_PATH in the Makefile, something
like -L/home/me/pathforMKL/lib.

You only need to set the tbb variable to no if you get a compile-time
error about being able to find the Intel TBB (thread building block)
header file.

The Makefile has two variables FFT_INC and FFT_PATH which point to the
fftMPI src dir.  This is so the test apps can find the fftMPI header
files and library files created when you compiled fftMPI.  If you use
fftMPI from your own program, built in another location, you will need
to either install fftMPI in a standard place (e.g. under /usr/local)
as discussed on the "compile"_compile.html doc page, or you will need
settings in your Makefile to point to the fftMPI src directory.
