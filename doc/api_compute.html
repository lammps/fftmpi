<H3>API for FFT compute() 
</H3>
<P>This fftMPI method can be called as many times as desired to perform
forward and backward FFTs for a specific grid size and layout across
processors.  The code examples are for 3d FFTs.  Just replace "3d" by
"2d" for 2d FFTs.
</P>
<HR>

<P>API:
</P>
<PRE>void compute(FFT_SCALAR *in, FFT_SCALAR *out, int flag); 
</PRE>
<P>The FFT_SCALAR datatype is defined by fftMPI to be "double" (64-bit)
or "float" (32-bit) for double-precision or single-precision FFTs.
</P>
<P>The "in" pointer is the input data to the FFT, stored as a 1d vector of
contiguous memory for the FFT grid points this processor owns.
</P>
<P>The "out" pointer is the output data from the FFT, also stored as a 1d
vector of contiguous memory for the FFT grid points this processor
owns.
</P>
<P>What is stored in the in and out 1d vectors are "tiles" of 2d or 3d
FFT grid data that each processor owns.  The extent of the tiles and
the way the data is ordered is defined by the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup()
method</A>.  The <A HREF = "layout.html">layout</A> doc page explains
what tiles are and gives more details on how the FFT data is ordered
as a 1d vector.
</P>
<P>Note that in and out can be the same pointer, in which case the FFT is
computed "in place", although there is additional internal memory
allocated by fftMPI to migrate data to new processors and reorder it.
The <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A> returns a variable "fftsize" which
should be used to allocate the necessary size of the in and out
vectors.  Because this memory is used by fftMPI at intermediate stages
of a 2d or 3d FFT, fftsize may be larger than the number of grid
points a processor initially owns.
</P>
<P>When flag is set to 1, a forward FFT is performed.  When flag is set
to -1, a backward FFT is performed.
</P>
<P>For a forward FFT, the input data (in pointer) is a "tile" of grid
points defined by the "in i/j/k lo/hi" indices specified in the
<A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A> and ordered by its "nfast, nmid,
nslow" arguments.  Similarly, the output data (out pointer) is a
"tile" of grid points defined by the "out i/j/k lo/hi" indices and
ordered by permutation of the "nfast, nmid, nslow" arguments as
specified by the permute flag.
</P>
<P>For a backward FFT, it is the opposite.  The input data (in pointer)
is a "tile" of grid points defined by the "out i/j/k lo/hi" indices
with ordering implied by the permute flag.  And the output data (out
pointer) is a "tile" of grid points defined by the "in i/j/k lo/hi"
indices and orderd by the "nfast, nmid, nslow" arguments of the
<A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A>.
