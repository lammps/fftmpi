<CENTER><H2>Manual for the fftMPI library 
</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H4>22 Dec 2020 version 
</H4></CENTER>
<P>The fftMPI library is designed to perform parallel 2d or 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
distributed-memory machines using MPI (message passing interface
library) to move data between processors.

<P>The fftMPI library was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE. It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the BSD Public
License (BSD).  See the LICENSE file in the distribution.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The primary developer of the fftMPI library is <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A> at
Sandia National Laboratories, who can be contacted at sjplimp at
sandia.gov. Additional collaborators are listed on the <A HREF = "http://fftmpi.sandia.gov">fftMPI
website</A>.
</P>

<LI><A HREF = "http://lammps.github.org/lammps/fftmpi.git">GitHub site</A> = clone or report bugs, pull requests, etc
<LI>Questions, bugs, suggestions: email to sjplimp at sandia.gov or post to GitHub

<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: the GitHub site will not be stood up until ~Oct 2018.

<P>The fftMPI library replaces the older <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/docs/fft/README.html">Parallel FFT Package</A>,
which was developed around 1997 for the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS molecular dynamics
code</A>.  Both fftMPI and the older package are
available from this <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html">download site</A>.
</P>
<P>My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies when I was creating the
original Parallel FFT Package.  Thanks also to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding data
remapping and FFT details from the user.
</P>
